[{"content":"In this post I\u0026rsquo;ll report some hands I played during this year.\nHand 1 Let\u0026rsquo;s start in medias res:\nThe bidding is not particularly exciting, just a standard Smolen sequence over 1NT. The play is reported under the diagram. The situation looks bleak: we already lost 3 tricks and we still have to tackle trumps. To bring trumps in with zero losers, we must hope for an original 4-1 break with stiff J in North. We\u0026rsquo;ll need to finesse twice, starting with the \u0026#9829;Q, and then finesse the \u0026#9829;9. But even if trumps come in, we\u0026rsquo;ll be one trick short since we won\u0026rsquo;t be able to ruff a Spade. So we\u0026rsquo;ll need some other way to find the fateful 10th trick. A squeeze looks like a great idea since, as we need South to have four Hearts for our plan to succeed (bringing in trumps), North will be a favorite to hold the Club guard on top of the sure Spade guard. But, still, communications are a bit messy and a simple squeeze can\u0026rsquo;t be set up, so we\u0026rsquo;ll need to go with a trump squeeze. Having said so, while in dummy, we play the \u0026#9829;Q. Imagine that South doesn\u0026rsquo;t cover (immaterial if he does) and the J drops. Now we know we can make the contract if North has at least 4 Clubs: we cash the \u0026diams;A discarding a Club, then we play a club to the A and ruff a Club. Now we play Heart to the 10, North discarding a Spade.\nHere the diagram of the situation: Now we cash the \u0026hearts;A and North is squeezed: if he parts with a Spade, we cash the \u0026spades;A and ruff a Club to enjoy the established Spade; if he discards a Club, we ruff a Club, dropping both the King and the Queen, get back in hand with the \u0026spades;A and enjoy the established Club. Nice!\nHand 2 Not a really nice slam, but after the lead I was relieved as we already have two Spade tricks in the bag. South played small and I took with the Q. Then, I played the \u0026clubs;Q, which was covered. Now I cannot go down no matter what I played, so I played a Heart (can you see why is it OK to risk a 6-0 Heart break? Hint: I saw it because I was looking for a squeeze) to the Q, which held, then cashed two Clubs ending in dummy (splitting 2-2). North discarded a Diamond and South a Heart, which gave me quite a clear picture about the position: it looked like South had 5 Hearts and North 5 Diamonds (he has two Clubs and one Heart, and he didn\u0026rsquo;t discard a Spade so he has not six of them). And, indeed, when I played the \u0026hearts;J (covered), North discarded a Spade. When I cashed another Club, North parted with a Spade, I discarded a Heart from dummy and South did the same. I tried to cash another Club, hoping for a wrong discard and, indeed, South parted with the wrong suit, Spades, isolating the Spade menace! Now it was a matter of cashing the Ace of Spades, dropping the King, which brings us in the following position:\nNow, when I cash the \u0026clubs;7, a classic double squeeze operates.\nHand 3 This one was a curious hand to play, as I found no sensible way to tackle it. My line was quite straightforward: I took the Spade lead with the \u0026spades;A and played a Heart to the Q, which was captured. On a trump return I had in mind to play a small Diamond to the 9 (which was probably best to start with, instead of trumps) as I didn\u0026rsquo;t like the idea to open up Clubs, but a Spade came back, so I discarded a Club from hand and took with the \u0026spades;K in dummy. I was quite happy as now I could play a Diamond to the King without opening up the Club suit, which might have endplay potential if the situation got ripe. The \u0026diams;9 was covered by the J, I played the King, which was captured, then South played a Spade. I ruffed that in hand, ruffed a Diamond and played another Spade, on which North discarded a Diamond. Here I overlooked the situation, as, since North covered the 9 with the J and did not play a Diamond back when he took the \u0026hearts;A, he could not have QJxxx or Jxxx in Diamond, so he must have had Jxx. Now I should have had a complete count as South didn\u0026rsquo;t lead a Club, so he\u0026rsquo;s definitely not singleton in Clubs (or he has a Q singleton, in which case I can make even if I play Hearts the wrong way), and this brings us to his probable starting distribution: 5-1-5-2, meaning that North must be 3-3-3-4. Now I had a lock by simply playing the Heart King and ruffing a Diamond: if North overruffs he\u0026rsquo;s endplayed, if he discards a Club, I can play Hearts and endplay him no matter what. Instead, I was sure (don\u0026rsquo;t ask me why!) I had to ruff both Diamonds to get to 10 tricks, basically playing a dummy reversal. So I played a Diamond, ruffed and overruffed; and now North still had a small Heart to endplay me, forcing me to open up the Clubs. Result: one off and quite a bit of steam.\nHand 4 Finally some defense. Here I was seated in East and you can see the bidding and lead in the diagram. \u0026spades;K ducked and \u0026spades;Q continuation, captured, dummy discarding a Club. Declarer now wrongly tried the Diamond finesse and now I had to lead. I knew declarer must have had the Club Ace, as the play is otherwise nonsensical: we could now get 2 Spades, 2 Clubs and 1 Diamond, so declarer has, almost for sure, the hand in the diagram. The situation looked quite bleak to me and I thought the best hope was to play a Heart, hoping for partner to duck and for declarer to repeat the finesse. Now partner could take, cash the Spade and play another Heart, leaving declare unable to come up with the 9th trick, as I couldn\u0026rsquo;t get squeeze by that time. So I played a small Heart, and my partner didn\u0026rsquo;t duck has I hoped. He took the \u0026hearts;K, cashed the \u0026spades;J and played a Spade. Now, on the run of Hearts i got squeezed.\nMy partner didn\u0026rsquo;t duck as I hoped but that would have been immaterial as I had miscounted and forgot that, even if he ducked, the \u0026hearts;Q was sitting in dummy, reachable thanks to Diamonds without breaking up communications, ready to be cashed and squeezed me in Clubs and Diamonds, forcing me to get endplayed in Diamonds.\nAt the table, I felt there was some way to beat the contract as the Diamond play was clearly wrong, giving up an extra trick to defenders without any clear benefits. And, indeed, the right way came to my mind just before I picked up the cards for the next board (as usual, so you can curse while you badly play the next hand, too): I could count 4 tricks for the defence (2 \u0026spades;,1 \u0026diams; and 1 \u0026hearts;), so it was simply a matter of establishing an extra trick, and not about breaking up declarer\u0026rsquo;s communications! And, should have been clear to me, the only suit in which this trick can be established is Clubs (as I knew declare would have played on Clubs with Axx \u0026clubs;). The only thing I would have needed was to play a small Club, giving up a trick and helping to establish dummy\u0026rsquo;s Club, of course, but declarer wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have any way to really establish them: there weren\u0026rsquo;t enough entries! So, no way to get Clubs tricks before defense is able to get 5 tricks: if declarer unblocked the \u0026clubs;A, whenever my partner took his \u0026hearts;K, he could cash his master Spade and play a Club for me to cash the King. If declarer tried to play Heart to the J to open up his communications and simultaneously remove West entry to the Spade, it would have been sufficient for West to duck, removing a vital entry for dummy\u0026rsquo;s Clubs. The idea to give up a trick to establish one trick later was quite counter-intuitive, wasn\u0026rsquo;t it?\nHand 5 This is a hand I played during the 7th World Youth Transnational Bridge Championships.\nI\u0026rsquo;m quite proud of this hand to be sincere. Lead was \u0026diams;2, nominally 4th best. Clearly, the position is fairly simple: we have 8 tricks and we need the 9th, but we can\u0026rsquo;t afford to lose any extra tricks outside diamonds as it would be the 5th trick for the defence. The best approach is, before starting Clubs, to draw 4 round of Hearts, following the old adage \u0026ldquo;When you have 8 tricks, start by cashing them.\u0026rdquo;. Opponents followed three rounds. On the 4th round Est, knowing I had 4 Spades, discarded the \u0026spades;J, a strange discard that probably comes from JT9xx \u0026spades;, but this was suspicious as, with that holding, he might as well tried his luck in Spades instead of Diamonds. I discarded a Club from dummy and West discarded the \u0026diams;4. Now the situations is quite weird, as West did not even suffer to discard the Diamond, and I though with an original holding of 5 Diamonds he might as well have thought at least a couple of seconds (I played the hand extremely fast on purpose to not let the opponents think in the early tricks). So now I decided to go with my read and play East for a 5-3-5-0, imagining a layout like this:\nPlaying a Diamond and hoping for the \u0026diams;K in West, which would mean that the defence cannot both set up a Spade and manage to run Diamonds (as Spades need to be played by East and for him to get in on the first round he must block the suit), and if that happens, I can throw in West with the Queen of Spades, or, if they unblock the suit and cash it (what happened at the table), the last Diamond squeezes West. If they cash only three Diamonds and then play Spades, I can again endplay West by playing the Q of Spade. A really beautiful hand!\nHand 6 This another hand I played during the 7th World Youth Transnational Bridge Championships. This time, as you can see, I doubled a contract and I had to manage to beat it.\nAfter this telling auction, you must defend 3NT Doubled. I led the \u0026clubs;Q, West following, partner playing the \u0026clubs;6 (UDCA attitude I thought, turns out, in this situation, is quite a mess what signal should partner provide and that spawned a quite heated discussion). Now I basically had quite a precise idea of declarer hand: he has not looked for a fit in a major, so he must be quite short in Hearts and Spades. Besides, he has not that many points, so his bid must be based on a strong Diamond suit, probably at least 6 winners. Now I already had the correct idea to beat the contract but, I must admit it, I had a moment of fear and insecurity: the logic of the defence was crystal clear, declarer had at least 7 tricks in the bag, and if he had 7 Diamonds he would have had 8, and I had to play him for 2-1-7-3 to have some hope to beat the contract. Besides, the required defence would have beaten the contract even if declarer would have been 2-1-6-4. But, I was unsure about the meaning of my partner\u0026rsquo;s carding, and I hoped, in a silly way, for him to have \u0026clubs;10, so I played a small club. Obviously, my partner produced the much dreaded 3. Now I had already gave the contract away, as I saw that, if declarer cashed everything, I would have been endplayed. But, luckily, declarer, unaware of the position, tried to sneak past my Ace of Heart to steal the ninth trick. I gave it a bit of thought, but I knew the only way to beat the contract now is to play declarer for 1-2-6-4, which is what I did: I went up with the \u0026hearts;A, cashed AK \u0026spades; and, finally, endplayed West with a Diamond. Here the complete diagram: Spectacular defence, indeed, but, had I trusted my insight and reasoning at the first opportunity, it would have been even more spectacular (and less risky!).\nThat\u0026rsquo;s all for today.

The CIP can be stated as such: “How are we to interpret statistical measures of association as causal measures of effects of exposures?\u0026quot;. In this post I\u0026rsquo;ll discuss Broadbent\u0026rsquo;s theory and his objections to a causal models based solution to the CIP. I will next attempt to demonstrate why his arguments fall short and why even his method cannot be said to have resolved some of the issues he identifies in the causal models approach.\nBroadbent\u0026rsquo;s Diagnosis (and Treatment) According to Broadbent, epidemiologists are interested in causality for a variety of reasons, including to influence policymakers, to distinguish between different types of associations, to give their research a strong theoretical foundation, etc. Despite this, they avoid using causal concepts as much as they can. However, it is impossible for an epidemiologist to not indicate or make an implicit causal assumption while discussing associations, even when this avoidance is properly employed. Both practically speaking and theoretically speaking, this conclusion is essential. This leads to a problem that various authors, including Pearl, claim to have solved. Broadbent disagrees and offers a thorough analysis of the issue at hand, which is handled in the section after this one.\nThe CIP In [Broadbent 2013] the author presents an interesting challenge that epidemiologist constantly face, named the Causal Interpretation Problem ( CIP):\n[\u0026hellip;]how to understand the causal import of a measure of association on those occasions when it is used to express a causal fact, as well as a fact about an association. [Broadbent 2013]\nThis is a really interesting problem which fundamentally rests on the fact that mathematical measures of association are causally neutral. As Cartwright points out: “No causes in, no causes out\u0026quot;, so we are facing the challenge to propose an account capable of interpreting measures of association as measures of causal strength. Broadbent proposal in based on an explanatory approach to the problem.\nThe Explanatory Approach Broadbent\u0026rsquo;s aim is not to propose a general theory of causation, but “an account of what measures of strength of association means […] when they are used to represent […] causal facts\u0026quot; [Broadbent 2013]. His proposal is the following:\nA measure of strength of association is a measure of causal strength if and only if the exposure explains the measured net difference in outcome. [Broadbent 2013]\nThe notion of explanation used here is based on the idea of contrastive explanation developed by Lipton, which make use of a Difference Condition as a necessary but not sufficient condition to characterize a good contrastive explanation. This condition is a sort of reverse of the “difference making\u0026quot; condition used by counterfactual theories: the difference lays not in the cause, but in how the effect is displayed, in the sense that\n[A] cause makes a difference in that had it is a difference between the effect being as it is and the effect being different or absent. [Broadbent 2013]\nThis idea is cashed out with the following counterfactual:\nReverse Counterfactual If \\(c\\) causes \\(e\\) then \\(\\neg Oe \\mathrel{\\mathop\\Box}\\mathrel{\\mkern-2.5mu\\rightarrow} \\neg Oc\\) . [Broadbent 2013]\nBroadbent then uses this framework to propose a solution to the CIP, stating that we must explain difference in outcomes in two population citing a difference in exposure, which causes at least degree \\(n\\) of the outcome in the exposed group, with degree \\(n\\) being any measure of strength of association [Broadbent 2013].\nThis solution seems to beg the question regarding causality (since “to cause at least degree \\(n\\) \u0026quot; appeals to the notion of causation), but Broadbent states that, while this is true if we take “to cause at least degree \\(n\\) \u0026quot; to be a general causation claim, this is not a problem if we interpret this statement as a quantification over individual cases, reducing general causal claims to quantitative claims about singular causation, avoiding circularity.\nCausal Models In this section I will briefly describe and define causal models and their features. I will then present Broadbent\u0026rsquo;s argument against the causal models approach for solving the CIP.\nWhat a Causal Models Is A causal model is a mathematical model that represents causal relationships within a system, thus enabling to predict, or infer, it\u0026rsquo;s behaviour. It consists of a causal structure (a set of variables \\(=V\\) and a set of pairs \\(\\{\\langle X, Y \\rangle ; \\ldots\\}\\) , where \\(X, Y \\in V\\) , with the latter representing direct functional relationships between variables) and a set of parameters assigning values to the functional relationship of each variable based on its parent: \\(x_i = f_i(pa_i)\\) where \\(pa_i\\) are the parents of \\(x_i\\) 1. [Pearl 2009]\nA causal model can assign probability values to counterfactual claims about the system, predict effects of interventions and entail probabilistic (in)dependence between variables [Hitchcock 2020]. It can be used in a reverse fashion too: given a probability distribution and some constraints is possible to determine a unique causal model (or, missing the constraints, a family of causal models) that fits the data and describes the system2. Causal models can be represented via direct graphs, where arrows between variables represent causal relationships. An example is given in Figure 1.\nA Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG) Where arrow tips represent the causal relationship between variables as prescribed by the set of pairs: \\(\\langle A,B\\rangle; \\langle A,C\\rangle; \\langle B,D\\rangle\\) . Causal models have seen, since the advent of the multi-causal model of disease and the development of a complex and effective framework (mostly thanks to Pearl), a surge in popularity in the context of epidemiological research: thanks to their features, causal models are the best way to represent complex systems, in which multiple interaction contribute to the onset of a disease or a state of ill health. They are seen by some authors as the best way to make causal inferences and to analyze the causal dynamics of a system or phenomenon [Pearl 2009].\nBroadbent argues for the incapability of the causal models approach to solve the CIP, laying out some of its problems. In the next section I will present Broadbent\u0026rsquo;s analysis of causal models approaches to the CIP.\nCausal Models and the CIP Causal models can, in principle, offer a solution to the CIP, namely, they can interpret causal claims about population as a claim about\n[…]what would happen under the assumption that certain variables have certain values and that certain relations between variables hold. [Broadbent 2013]\nWe can easily see that this kind of claims are quite easily yielded by causal models simply by modifying a structural equation from \\(x_i = f_i(pa_i)\\) to \\(x_i=\\mathbf{x}\\) and calculating the resulting probability distribution or the values of the descendant variables.\nBroadbent points out two primary problems of causal models relating to the CIP. The first one is an epistemological problem: the question regarding what would happen translates to a question regarding the actuality of the model. If more than one model fits the data and only some of them satisfy the conditions for causation specified by the modeller, we cannot tell the correct causal interpretation until we decide which is the correct model. This is a kind of under-determination problem.\nThe second one is a metaphysical problem: causal models do not really answer the question regarding causation, and they are at risk of circularity too. The first claim is justified by the author by saying that\nOne can still seek to dream up unusual causal scenarios in which the conditions for causation specified by a given theorist are not satisfied. [Broadbent 2013]\nThis claim struck me as highly unspecific and I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t regard it as a real argument, but I will discuss it nonetheless in the next section.\nThe risk of circularity, following Broadbent, is embedded in causal models because of their structure: causal models are never complete, the modeller need to make decisions about what factors to capture and to use in a model, excluding some others. Those decision rely on a notion of causation, since we are excluding factors that could causally influence the outcome, but, by stipulation, do not. Since the notion of influence on which the model relies is causal, we cannot treat causal models as a way to reduce causation and explain the interpretation of measures of association as causal.\nI will discuss all those problems in the following section.\nProblems of Broadbent\u0026rsquo;s Arguments and Account In this section I will address the problems pointed out by Broadbent regarding causal models and try to show that they affect the explanatory approach too. The discussion of those problems by Broadbent is vague and not in depth, so I will try to infer the underlying position and judgments that inform the arguments.\nBesides, Broadbent\u0026rsquo;s arguments do not really challenge the causal models-based proposal for solving the CIP, but they aim directly at causal models, trying to undermine them. I do not really understand this line of discussion since it seems that Broadbent aim is to challenge causal models as methods for discovering causal relationships, instead it should be to dismiss the proposed solution to the CIP. Given that, I will try to defend the causal models approach taking for granted the validity of its solution to the CIP.\nAfter the discussion of Broadbent arguments, I will lay out some problems of Broadbent\u0026rsquo;s proposal regarding the CIP and the general framework of the contrastive approach. The problems presented are general in nature and the argument are meant to be general arguments against some of Broadbent\u0026rsquo;s positions, without a narrow focus.\nResponses to the Epistemological Problem The epistemological problem of causal models regards the fact that we have no means to distinguish an actual causal model from a non actual causal model given that the data fits both of them, so we cannot be sure about the correctness of the causal interpretation.\nWhile I recognize this as a big concern, I have doubts that the explanatory approach does not display the same sort of problem. It states that to explain a difference in outcome, we must cite a difference in exposure, which causes at least degree of \\(n\\) of the outcome cases.\nThe problem pointed out for causal models is translatable, for the explanatory approach, in the following: how do we know that an exposure is the actual cause of at least degree of \\(n\\) outcomes? If is impossible to determine with certainty if some exposure is a cause or not in a causal model (since it\u0026rsquo;s possible that some other model fits the data, in which some different factor acts as a cause, or there is no cause at all, etc.) how is it possible that we can determine a causal role of an exposure by appealing to the claim that exposure did cause the outcome in at leas degree of \\(n\\) cases? It is not useful to appeal to some effect-led difference making conditions, since the causal model would be able to capture those too, and if that was the way of discriminating between which variable is a cause and which is not, than we should be able to determine a unique causal model or, at least, a family of models all of which identify the same variable as a cause, but with some differences in respect of other variables\u0026rsquo; roles3.\nI can see a lot of problems with Broadbent\u0026rsquo;s claim. Causal models try to capture the underlying causal structure of the phenomenon. Imagine a case in which the observable variables underdetermine the models (in the sense that more models can fit the data). This is a case where the causal dynamics of the models are not clear at all, in the sense that we cannot determine with certainty which variable is causally related to another variable. If a causal models fails in this identification, how can the explanatory approach be sure that the exposure is the cause of at least degree of \\(n\\) of the outcome observed, given that we cannot capture the underlying causal structure of the system? Could not there be another cause?\nOverlooking this problem seems justified only if Broadbent gives his approach an unfair advantage: that the explanatory approach can be informed by causal judgment that humans constantly make, which can help determine the cause with more certainty, while the causal models approach is not granted this advantage. When a causal models fails to capture a system with certainty, it seems difficult to me that we could be able to identify the underlying causal structure. But the modeller can make informed guesses based on background knowledge, rules and principles, and the natural causal insight that humans possess, which can help to assign a greater probability of actuality to a specific model, not counting the already cited Minimality and Faithfulness conditions. The fact that variables can usually be time ordered helps too.\nBesides, throughout the book, Broadbent is rarely concerned with truth (which seems what he means with actual). For example, truth is not the focus or the aim of good epidemiological research; instead stability is. I would argue that this sudden preoccupation for truth is instrumental for arguing against causal models. If we are faithful to the concept of stability, we should agree that if a causal model is hold to be stable then its output regarding what measure of association is to be interpreted causally must be accepted.\nResponses to the Metaphysical Problem As we saw the metaphysical problem of causal models regards their inability to answer the question about causation. I partially agree with this claim, but I find the argument that Broadbent brings to the discussion not specific and vague.\nIt might be true that we can construct causal scenarios in which the condition for causation are not satisfied, but I would argue that a solid causal discovery framework (e.g. [Pearl 2009]). Besides, for what I can think of, unusual causal scenarios are rarely found in nature, and a framework for causal interpretation of association measures is not meant to give a general account of causation, as Broadbent too points out when presenting the explanatory approach. Causal models achieve a good explanation of the causal import of a measure of association in the context of epidemiology, social sciences, economics etc., their aim is not to reduce causation in general. Anyway, those kind of claims can be made for every approach to causality, so I\u0026rsquo;ll dismiss it without further discussion4.\nProblems of the Explanatory Approach Broadbent proposes the explanatory approach as a solution to the CIP. While I appreciate the novelty of the proposal and the focus on effect-led difference making and the contrastive approach, I have found some problems in the proposal.\nThe first problem regards the appeal to singular causation in the explanatory approach. It has been extensively argued about the difficulties of determining instances of singular causation, even with the contrastive approach that Broadbent uses throughout the book [Broadbendt 2013].\nThe problem with the explanatory approach is that we cannot determine that a token outcome has been caused by the exposure, since this knowledge is almost always epistemically inaccessible (we cannot claim that this instance of smoking did cause this lung cancer, since we do not have the means to determine if this is true or not).\nAnother problem is the primitiveness of the notion of singular causation that Broadbent states, without justification. This is a quite debatable choice. As Danks points out, claims of singular causation are usually rooted in general causation claims (we say that this instance of coffee drinking caused this tremors because we know that coffee may cause tremors, as Danks points out):\nsingular causation requires knowledge of (at least) both the general causation that applies in cases of this type, as well as details about this particular case. [Broadbent 2013]\nSo even Broadbent proposal is at risk of circularity, nevertheless he claims it is not and addresses the problem in few sentences. Broadbent needs to justify why quantifying over singular causal claims does not lead to circularity regarding general causal claims more in depth, otherwise his position is precarious.\nRegarding the contrastive approach, it can be said that there are no clear boundaries for the selection of the contrast class. The selection is informed by background knowledge: to determine the cause of a fire in a spaceship needs a different contrast class than determine the cause of a fire in a house: namely, oxygen presence is relevant for one case but not for the other [Broadbent 2013]. The selection is itself informed by causal judgements too: if we are to explain why smoking causes lung cancer, our contrast class will not comprehend people that has been exposed to asbestos for example, because we know that asbestos has a causal relationship with lung cancer.\nAs stated earlier: it is always possible to imagine unlikely scenarios in which the conditions for causality do not hold, and this is a problem encountered by every account that tries to address the CIP and causality in general. A clear example of some headaches that the contrastive approach may cause is the notion of disease as defined in [Broadbent 2013], in which the selection of the contrast class is fundamental for the correct definition of a disease but no conditions are specified for the construction of this class, leaving no clear instruction regarding this selection.\nFinally, the definition provided for the circumstances under which an exposure is deemed a cause is open to not genuine causes. There could be an infinite number of variables that, under this approach, could be regarded as causes. To function properly and be successful, for the explanatory approach some omitted clauses that permit us to distinguish between causes and non causes must be made explicit. Either a parasitic behavior toward causal models is required, so the model can skim and leave only actual causes for the explanatory approach to work on, or some sort of background-informed judgement is required to avoid the chance of non-causes being treated as causes. The former would be basically a declaration of surrender since it would state the necessity of causal models for the discrimination between genuine and non genuine cause, giving them a strong position to argue for a causal models-based CIP solution. The latter needs specification which is omitted and should thus be produced. Besides, background-informed judgement are notoriously subjective and difficult to asses properly.\nConclusions We have seen how most of the problems highlighted by Broadbent regarding causal models and the CIP can be challenged and how even his own account suffers some of them.\nI find Broadbent\u0026rsquo;s approach really interesting and fecund: its intuitiveness and simplicity are surprising, and is absolutely effective. But the proposal is, in my opinion, still rather vague. It is in its early stages and still not thoroughly analyzed and challenged by the literature, which is mainly afferent to the epidemiological field or regards topics other than the CIP and causal interpretation.\nI showed why I believe causal models approaches are not as weak as Broadbent depicts them and can therefor aspire to a solution to the CIP, especially the solution proposed by Menzies [Menzies 2004]. I think it would be wrong not to treat causal models as a good approach to causality and the CIP only because they may fail in some really strange situations. If we had a complete framework of causality, able to capture every kind of causation regardless of the causal scenario, it would be the case to advocate for it and let go causal models. But we still do not have this framework.\nDisregarding causal models for this reason would be counterproductive, since they have proved themselves highly successful and an ever-growing research effort is put on them. The raising of AI and deep neural network has proved to be fertile territory for those kind of approaches, not only in epidemiology, but in all kinds of fields. This kind of success is not explicable if they were not able to capture, at least partially, the hidden causal nets of complex systems and phenomena, and to make causal inference and explanation easy and accessible.\nBibliography Broadbent, Alex. “Causation and models of disease in epidemiology.” Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part C :Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences 40, 4 (2009): 302–311. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.shpsc.2009.09.006.\n\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;. “Causes of causes.” Philosophical Studies 158, 3 (2012): 457–476. .

Causality. Cambridge University Press, 2009.\nGiven the purpose of this post, disturbance components will be ignored.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nSee [Hitchcock 2020], Section 4 for a thorough analysis.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nIn this case the Minimality and Faithfulness condition, plus Occam\u0026rsquo;s Razor, can help us skim and identify which causal model to use. See [Pearl 2009], [Hitchcock 2020], [Halpern and Pearl 2005] for a detailed presentation of those conditions.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nIs always possible to construct an unlikely causal scenario which gives rise to problems given a definition of what is a causal relation, or what is to interpret a measure of association as having causal import. I do not mean to dismiss this problem as not relevant. Research is always pushed by convoluted and clever counterexamples that philosophers are able to find, so I\u0026rsquo;d prefer to treat them as an occasion for striving for improvement and adjusting the account, and not as a serious undermining argument, unless the flaw is displayed exclusively by said account. This is not the case, so I will proceed bypassing this point [Danks 2017].\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","date":"2023-01-04","permalink":"https://alvarogaiotti.github.io/post/the-causal-interpretation-problem/","tags":["Causality","Broadbent","Causal Models","DAG"],"title":"The Causal Interpretation Problem"}]
