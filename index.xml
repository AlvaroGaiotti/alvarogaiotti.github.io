Hand 1 Let&amp;rsquo;s start in medias res:
The bidding is not particularly exciting, just a standard Smolen sequence over 1NT. The play is reported under the figure, and the situation looks bleak: we already lost 3 tricks and we still have to tackle trumps. To bring trumps in with zero losers, we must hope for a original 4-1 break with the stiff J in North. We will need to finesse twice, starting with the &amp;#9829; Q, and then finesse the &amp;#9829; 9. But even if trumps come in, we will be one trick short since we won&amp;rsquo;t be able to ruff a Spade.</description></item><item><title>Contacts</title><link>https://alvarogaiotti.github.io/contacts/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jan 2023 13:15:20 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://alvarogaiotti.github.io/contacts/</guid><description>You can send me an email at: alvaro&amp;nbsp;(dot)&amp;nbsp;gaiotti&amp;nbsp;(at)&amp;nbsp;proton&amp;nbsp;(dot)&amp;nbsp;me.</description></item><item><title>The Causal Interpretation Problem</title><link>https://alvarogaiotti.github.io/post/the-causal-interpretation-problem/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jan 2023 00:22:37 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://alvarogaiotti.github.io/post/the-causal-interpretation-problem/</guid><description>This post is a rewritten version of a paper I wrote for the Philosophy of Science course I took during my Master&amp;rsquo;s Degree.
Abstract In support of a solution based on contrastive explanation, Broadbent [Broadbent, 2013] argues that causal models cannot aspire to a solution of the Causal Interpretation Problem ( CIP). The CIP can be stated as such: “How are we to interpret statistical measures of association as causal measures of effects of exposures?&amp;quot;. In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll discuss Broadbent&amp;rsquo;s theory and his objections to a causal models based solution to the CIP. I will next attempt to demonstrate why his arguments fall short and why even his method cannot be said to have resolved some of the issues he identifies in the causal models approach.</description></item><item><title>About me</title><link>https://alvarogaiotti.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jan 2023 16:33:49 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://alvarogaiotti.github.io/about/</guid><description>Hello everyone, I&amp;rsquo;m Alvaro.
