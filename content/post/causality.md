## Two theories of causation

### Hume on causation

>we may define a cause to be _an object, followed by another, and where all the objects, similar to the first, are followed by objects similar to the second. Or in other words, where, if the first object had not been, the second never had existed._
>
> David Hume (E 7.29, SBN 76-7)

Those two definitions looks pretty similar, don't they? If Hume says so, they must be, am I right? Or are you one of those
scholastics fanboys who despises Hume's glorious work? Well, if you are one of them, this time you might be right (about Hume being
wrong, not his work not being admirable). Let me walk you through one of the toughest probles of contemporary philosophy: Causation.

First of all, what is causation? What does it mean for some thing to cause another one? Hume has two answers to this question, you can see them in
the quotation that started this post. But are those two definition really the same?

They are actually quite different, and each of them gave birth to some of the most succesful theories of causation: the _regularity_ and
_counterfactual_ theories of causation. Both those theories are concerned with explaining and telling us _what causation is_. Those kind of theories
are called _reductive_ theories: they try to _reduce_ causation to something else, something more foundamental and ontologically _simple_, so to speak.

### Regularity theories

Regularity teories of causation consists basically in the following position:

#### Na√Øve regularism
*c* causes *e* iff[^1]:
- *c* is spatially contiguous to *e*
- *e* is temporally successive to *c*
- all events of type *C* are *regularly* followed by events of type *E*

Now, this can look like a good definition for the regular folks. But we philosophers
like to make things hard, and here it doesn't event take much effort: think about a barometer
whose needle goes down when a storm is approaching. Is the needle lowering the cause of the incoming
storm? Naturally it's not. But, if you try to plug
$$
c = \text{the barometer's needle lowering}
$$
and
$$
e = \text{storm incoming}
$$
in the above definition, you get that, indeed, *c* causes *e*: barometer's needle
lowerings are, in a certain sense, spatially and temporally contiguous to incoming storms,
and they anticipate them pretty regularly. 



## Some other things

[^1]: *iff* means "if and only if"
